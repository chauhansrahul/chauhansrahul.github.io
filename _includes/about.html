                 <p>Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at BITS-Pilani, India, majoring in Computer Science. I am primarily interested in the real-life implications of technology and its use as a tool to enhance human productivity and comfort. When I'm not busy working, I like catching up with the latest movies or getting lost in a good mystery novel.</p> 
                  <p>My current research interests include Social Network Analysis, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Visual Computing, Front-end Web Development, and Android Software Development. I also enjoy studying the association of these with social elements like literature, art, wellness, and media. I am always open to exploring new areas of research and increasing my current capabilities!</p>
                 <p>You can get in touch with me for a copy of my Curriculum Vitae at <a href="mailto:tejal.wakchoure@gmail.com">tejal.wakchoure@gmail.com</a>.</p>
