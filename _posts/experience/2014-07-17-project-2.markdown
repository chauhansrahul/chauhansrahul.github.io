description: MLCAT (Mailing List Community Analysis Tool) is a mailing list parser that extracts information from an IMAP server-based mailing list such as senders and time stamps, and uses this information to construct conversation thread hypergraphs. A time-varying network analysis of such a hypergraph reveals participant behavior and communication patterns which can help form predictive models that help in understanding certain intricate characteristics of a social network.
