description: Health-based classification of an experimental batch of mice into 8 different classes by a model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks and exploratory data analysis techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). An available dataset containing the expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex was used and an accuracy of 97% was obtained on the predictions.
